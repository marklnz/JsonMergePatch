# JsonMergePatch

A simple C# implementation of Json Merge Patch as described in [IETF RFC 7386](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386). 

Initial version is a simple text based implementation of the processing described in the RFC, with a single simple test case that can be run by executing DOTNET RUN from the command line against the console app project.

In depth unit tests and optimization of the processing to come later.
